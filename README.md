# Image-Steganography-in-Java

Image Steganography Tool made in Java. It wokrs on Least Significant Bit (LSB) algorithm. Using this algorithm a text message is encrypted in an image. It also decrypts the message from the image. I have created simple GUI in Java using the Java Swing Library.

In order to use it we have to individually run the files EmbedMessage.java and DecodeMessage.java
